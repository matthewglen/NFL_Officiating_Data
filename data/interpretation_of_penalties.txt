The nflfastR 2019 data contains 48 unique penalty types. Here, I've displayed
each one and the positions that were flagged for this penalty at some point in
2019. I'll then write which referee gave the penalty according to the NFL's
definition of officiating responsibilities. For more own understand, and perhaps
useful to others, I have written definitions and reasoning where necessary.
