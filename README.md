# NFL_Officiating_Data
A repository to hold historical data on NFL officials, and hopefully functions to assign these to each game. Collated from public data, articles and game books, in to one useful, concise, repository available for public use.

<b>If you notice any inconsistencies or incorrect elements to the data, please raise it as an issue, or drop me a message, cheers!</b>

- Data folder contains a file called officials_by_game.csv. This contains the full crew for each game from 1999-2020. It will be updated through out the 2021 season and on.


Current plan:

- Make assumptions of who threw the flag for a specific penalty. These can me made using <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/officiating/the-officials/officials-responsibilities-positions/">the NFL's official definitions of responsibilities.</a>
- The penalty data (e.g. every penalty, from every game, from 1999 onwards) will come from <a href="https://github.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data">nflfastR-data</a>.

Thanks to:
- <a href="https://github.com/leesharpe/nfldata/blob/master/data/games.csv">Lee Sharp's games data</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR/a">nflfastR</a>

While this process is in development, I cant gaurantee the accuracy of ALL the data, but the accuracy should improve as the project evolves. As always, contributions, suggestions and collaboration are appreciated, just reach out!
